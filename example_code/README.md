# Relevant code

## Where does the code come from?

The code comes from the example of [Reclaimer Labs](https://www.reclaimerlabs.com/) shared by [GreatScott!](https://www.instructables.com/member/GreatScottLab/)

## Can I run this code on Arduino uno, nano, micro or leonardo?

No, they don't have enough SRAM(only 2KB)ï¼ŒIt is recommended to use a processor with SRAM of 4KB and aboveï¼Œ

## E.g. MCU

| MCU           | SRAM | Has it been testedï¼Ÿ |
| ------------- | ---- | -------------------- |
| STM32F030F4P6 | 4KB  | :yellow_heart:       |
| STM32F072CBT6 | 16KB | ðŸ’š                    |
| STM32F103C8T6 | 20KB | :yellow_heart:       |
| ESP8266       | 16KB | ðŸ’š                    |

## How can I run this code with stm32 on arduino ideï¼Ÿ
